            The Beatles were an English rock band that revolutionalized the pop scene from Liverpool all the way to New York. Their trendy clothing coupled with the signature haircut rocked the young and old alike. The band originally composed of five members but
            Pete(the drummist) left to continue his art course.

            The remaining four were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr who carried the Beatles name to where it was.As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry
            and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements. Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs
            in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass.
